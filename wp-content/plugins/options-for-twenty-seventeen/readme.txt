A quick note from the author:

"Thank you everyone for your support! We had no idea how much you wanted this plugin! We've created Options for Twenty Seventeen to make our lives easier when helping clients modify their default WordPress theme. Lots of people use Twenty Seventeen probably because there can't be a more supported theme than one that's provided by the WordPress developers! So our mission was to create a plugin that allows easy customization without any need for HTML, CSS, JavaScript or PHP knowledge whilst at the same time not making ANY changes to the theme itself or requiring a child theme (although child themes are supported). What does this mean? It means that the WordPress wizards can make changes to the theme and you can run updates without losing your modifications.

We'd like to thank everyone who has reported issues or suggested changes using the Support link above or by emailing us direct ... this plugin becomes even better because of you! We'd especially like to thank anyone who upgrades. Your money allows us to continue doing what we do :)

Keep the feedback coming!"

== Installation ==

Easily use this plugin to modify Wordpress default Twenty Seventeen theme ...

1) Install "Options for Twenty Seventeen" automatically or by uploading the ZIP file.
2) Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3) Find the additional features by clicking "Customise" in the "Appearance" admin menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've upgraded but it won't activate? =

THANK YOU! Your upgrade helps us to continue to do what we do. If you have already paid and your upgrade won't activate, please contact us so that we can investigate :)

= Why can't I change the fonts? =

Changing fonts in a Wordpress theme is not a customization that is limited to Twenty Seventeen. There are loads of plugins out there already that specifically do this already. We use [TK Google Fonts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tk-google-fonts/ "TK Google Fonts") for example.

= Why doesn't the colour picker work? =

Try disabling Advanced Twenty Seventeen plugin ;-) We've not checked it out yet but it looks like this plugin breaks the default colour picker control in Wordpress customiser.

= Is the upgrade a one-off payment or a subscription? =

The upgrade is a one-off payment for a single website.
